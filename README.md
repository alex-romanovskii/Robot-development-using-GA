In this question, we will solve the problem of the robot. The robot can move through the maze from the starting point to the exit point. The robot can move one slot in each of the four directions (right, left, up and down). If there is a wall in the same direction, the robot will not move.

Goal:
Solve the robot’s problem with genetic algorithm.

Tools:
1) Programming language – Python.
2) Evolutionary computation framework – DEAP.
